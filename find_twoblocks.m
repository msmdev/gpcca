% This function checks the sorted part of the Schurform RR for 2x2-blocks. 
% If a 2x2-block (corresponding to two complex conjugate
% eigenvalues, that MUST NOT be splitted) at positions (rr_i;i, rr_i;i+1,
% rr_i+1;i, rr_i+1;i+1) is found, the element rr_i+1;i is saved and the
% row-index i of the first row of the 2x2-block is saved. This row-index is
% then passed to gpcca.m and is excluded from further analysis.
    % Input:
    %   X           (N,n)-matrix containing the ordered Schur-vectors 
    %               columnwise
    %   RR          (N,N) ordered Schur matrix
    %   fileid      ID-string for the naming of output files
    % Output:
    %   badblocks   (n-1,1)-vector of 0's and 1's indicating cluster
    %               numbers i to exclude (if badblocks(i)=1) from further 
    %               analysis
    %   badblockrows    vector of cluster numbers to exclude
